# Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## üéØ Objective
To understand what makes a password strong by creating various types of passwords, testing them using an online password strength checker, and summarizing best practices for password security.

## üîß Tool Used
- [PasswordMeter](https://www.passwordmeter.com/)
- (Optional alternative tools: Kaspersky Password Checker, NordPass Strength Checker)

## Passwords Tested and Results

| Password          | Length | Complexity              | Score (%) | Feedback from Tool |
|-------------------|--------|--------------------------|-----------|---------------------|
| `hello123`        | 8      | lowercase + digits       | 26%       | Too short, weak     |
| `Hello@123`       | 9      | upper+lower+digit+symbol | 64%       | Moderate strength   |
| `H3ll0@W0rld2025!`| 15     | upper+lower+digits+symbol| 94%       | Strong              |
| `admin`           | 5      | common word              | 12%       | Very weak, common   |
| `Pa$$w0rd!Secure` | 15     | upper+symbol+digits      | 89%       | Strong              |




## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Strong Passwords

1. Use **12+ characters**.
2. Combine **uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols**.
3. Avoid **common words or predictable patterns** (e.g., "password123").
4. Never reuse passwords across accounts.
5. Use a **password manager** for storing complex passwords.

## üõ°Ô∏è Common Password Attacks Researched

| Attack Type      | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Brute Force**  | Tries every possible combination. Longer/complex passwords take longer.     |
| **Dictionary**   | Uses known/common passwords or wordlist files.                              |
| **Phishing**     | Tricks users into revealing passwords (not related to password complexity). |

## How Password Complexity Improves Security

- Increases the number of combinations exponentially.
- Slows down brute-force attacks significantly.
- Reduces chances of success in dictionary attacks.
- Makes pattern guessing more difficult for attackers.

---

## Tips Learned

- Password strength is more than just length‚Äîit needs diversity in characters.
- Online tools give an estimate but real safety comes from unpredictability and good practices.
- Consider passphrases or using password generators for best security.
